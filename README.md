This repository contains Code for the transition model showing the progression of samples through each DMM cluster, which are presented in Figure 1 and Extended Data Figure 2 of the "Temporal Development of the Gut Microbiome in Early Childhood - The TEDDY Study" by Stewart et al. (citation to be included).

The gut microbiome undergoes substantial development from birth into childhood and is believed to have significant consequences for long-term health, including the development of persistant islet autoimmunity (IA) and Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). In a multi-geographical population of 903 infants at-risk for T1D who developed IA and/or T1D by months 46 of age and their matched controls, we sought to characterize the gut microbiome from 3 to 46 months of life and determine the key covariates influencing its development. The study included two datasets, 1) 16S rRNA gene sequencing of >12,000 stool samples and 2) metagenomic sequencing of 10,867 stool samples.
